 'You don''t need to spend all of your hard earned money on bakery bread. Making your own bread at home is easy with the new Double Duty Dough Mixer by Berring. Unlike other bread machines that can be difficult to clean and store, the Double Duty Dough Mixer breaks down into five parts that can go directly into your dishwasher. This stainless steel appliance will mix dough for you in a fraction of the time it takes to knead dough by hand. The automated delay feature at the beginning of the mix cycle gives your ingredients time to reach room temperature, ensuring that your breads will rise as high as bakery bread. We guarantee that the accompanying Berring Best Breads recipe book will be a family favourite.',
